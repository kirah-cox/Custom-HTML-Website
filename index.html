            <p><i>Every</i> cookie made at the Kevin Cookie Company is crafted with only the finest ingredients.
                <br> Butter from grass fed cows.
                <br> Unbleached flour with the best flavor and textures.
                <br> Organic sugar only from India.
                <br> Eggs from chickens that listen to classical music.
                <br> Even our water is special.
                <br> It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up
                to retrieve.
            </p>
            <p>Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
